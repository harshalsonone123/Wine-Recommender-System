## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze a Winery dataset to derive meaningful insights using EDA techniques. Additionally, a Recommendation System is implemented based on the analysis to provide personalized recommendations to users.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from kaggle. It includes information about wineries, wine varieties, ratings, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This EDA provides a foundation for understanding the Winery dataset. Further analysis and insights gained from these visualizations will guide the development of a robust Recommendation System

## Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are primarily using three approaches. In content-based filtering, we do profiling based on what type of content any user is interested in and using the collected information, it recommends items. Another one is collaborative filtering, where we make clusters of similar users and use that information to make recommendations.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python 3.x
- jupyter

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/winery-eda-recommendation.git
    cd winery-eda-recommendation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the EDA and Recommendation System scripts:

    ```bash
    # Example command for running EDA
    python eda_script.py

    # Example command for running Recommendation System
    python recommendation_system.py
    ```
