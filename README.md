## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze a Winery dataset to derive meaningful insights using EDA techniques. Additionally, a Recommendation System is implemented based on the analysis to provide personalized recommendations to users.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [provide link to dataset source]. It includes [brief description of the dataset, e.g., information about wineries, wine varieties, ratings, etc.].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves [briefly describe the main steps and analyses performed]. The results of the EDA are documented in [link to EDA notebook or relevant files].

## Recommendation System

The Recommendation System is built using [mention the algorithm or approach used, e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering]. The system takes into account [explain the factors considered for recommendations, e.g., user preferences, wine characteristics]. The implementation details can be found in [link to the recommendation system code or relevant files].

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python 3.x
- [List any additional libraries and versions]
